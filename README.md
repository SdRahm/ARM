# ARM

This is my capstone project of my undergraduate program of Electrical and Electronics Engineering.
Here three members of our group worked to design RTL of ARM v5 processor.
We took the help of embedded reference manual of ARM v5 to understand the processor's workings.
Then we wrote the Verilog HDL code of the RTL.
Our main target was to design the system efficiently in terms of power and size. We had to code this in a way to make sure of that.
The project isn't completed totally.
Wer managed to run the 17 basic arithmetic, load-store amd branch instructions respective to their addressing modes.
